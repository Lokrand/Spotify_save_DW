## How it works
 - Spotify generate Discover Weekly playlist like [this](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZEVXcWlsrx2rT0bU?si=2f332d0c91bb4362) with unique tracks for each user.
 - But once playlist is regenerated all old track that you like in DW playlist will disappear
 - You can save them manually if you don't forget
 - OR use this service

4. Now if you don't have Spotify Premium (that means site can't control user playback) you can quickly play all songs in playlist to add them to new playlist ![enter image description here](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54314123/178078970-9bd523e4-bfed-4b35-a50a-e041c0c675b1.png)
5. When playlist start repeating itself a little dot will appear to indicate that you didn't lost any tracks
